# Object-Oriented-Programing-Java
A collection of Java programs created to practice and understand Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) concepts including classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Practicing Object-Oriented-Programming in Java

Today I build a simple Java project to strengthen my understanding of OOP fundamentals.

This project demonstrates :
## Concepts Used
- Classes  and objects
- Instance Variables 
- Method
- Object Creation using 'new' keyword
- Reference Variables
- Stack vs Heap Memory Concepts 
- Dot Operator

Looking forward to exploring constructors, encapsulation, and advanced OOP concepts next.
